As a passionate tech lover and artist, my life is a canvas of emotions painted with the colours of my experiences and events. It's a unique perspective that often leaves me with a whirlwind of feelings as I strive to strike a balance between my love for technology and my passion for art.

Recently, I achieved a significant milestone in my life - I got my first job and here I am trying to share this emotion with all the fellow readers. While it should have been a moment of pure elation, I found myself grappling with mixed emotions. I got rejoiced at the validation of my career getting an ignition, but another part of me felt a twinge of guilt for not always conforming to the traditional expectations of society. However, I realised that my art and emotions are intricately intertwined, and it's not always easy to separate the two.

Despite the challenges, I've come to accept that the artist in me is always alive, even during moments of financial struggles. It's a part of my identity that constantly seeks to create something meaningful out of the smallest inspirations. The artist in me is resilient, always waiting for the perfect opportunity to make the most out of the least. It's a reminder that art is not solely dependent on external circumstances, but rather, it's an expression of the innermost emotions that overflow and manifest into something beautiful.

One of my cherished dreams is to save enough money to gift my family a new house as a token of gratitude for there unwavering support and belief in my artistic pursuits. It's a symbolic gesture that represents my determination to make them proud and prove that *the road less travelled* is always not in that bad. This driving force keeps me motivated and focused on my craft, no matter the challenges I may encounter along the way.

However, amidst the moments of joy and humility, there are also instances of resentment and anger that arise from negative experiences with fake people in the industry. One such disappointment was with some WOW Agencies, which failed to deliver on their promises, leaving me feeling deceived and disheartened. It's a stark reminder that not everyone has good intentions, and the realities of the creative industry can be challenging to navigate.

Nevertheless, my artistic journey has also been a catalyst for personal growth and transformation. I've developed new habits and honed my skills beyond what I thought possible, pushing myself to grow from a boy to a man. It's been a profound and sometimes painful process, but it has shaped me into the person I am today.

Despite my inner struggles and moments of doubt, I find solace in expressing my thoughts and observations through my art. Whether it's writing down my reflections while watching movies like "Rang De Basanti" or finding inspiration in the simple act of daydreaming, my creativity knows no boundaries. It's through this outlet that I can channel my emotions, process my thoughts, and make sense of the complexities that come with being an artist.

In conclusion, the life of an artist who is also a tech lover is a constant journey of balancing emotions, navigating challenges, and embracing personal growth. It's a path that may be filled with ups and downs, but it's also one that allows me to express myself in unique and profound ways. I've learned that art and emotions are intertwined, and while it's not always easy, I'm committed to embracing the journey. As I continue to evolve, I'm hopeful that my work will inspire others and that I'll find purpose and fulfilment in creating something meaningful for the world. Here's to the artist in me, who may still face uncertainties, but who is determined to keep pushing boundaries and striving for greatness, one pixel at a time.
